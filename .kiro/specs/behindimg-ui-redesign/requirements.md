# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the existing image editor application to match a professional dark-themed UI design with text overlay capabilities. The redesign will transform the current interface into a modern "Back Image" application with comprehensive text customization controls and improved user experience.

**Critical Update**: The current AI model (U2Net) is insufficient for accurate foreground/background segmentation. This redesign includes upgrading to a more advanced AI model that can properly identify and separate foreground objects from backgrounds, enabling accurate text placement "behind" objects in images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dark-themed interface that matches the professional design reference, so that I have a visually appealing editing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the interface SHALL display with a dark background (#1a1a1a or similar)
2. WHEN viewing any UI element THEN all components SHALL use dark theme colors consistent with the reference design
3. WHEN interacting with controls THEN hover states SHALL maintain dark theme consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload images through a clearly defined upload area, so that I can easily add images to edit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the upload area SHALL display with a dashed border and upload icon
2. WHEN no image is uploaded THEN the area SHALL show "Click to upload an image" text with file format specifications
3. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the upload area SHALL be replaced with the image preview
4. WHEN dragging a file over the upload area THEN visual feedback SHALL be provided

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive text customization controls, so that I can create professional text overlays on my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the text customization panel loads THEN it SHALL display all controls: content, layer, font style, color, size, opacity, width stretch, height stretch, and position
2. WHEN adding text THEN I SHALL be able to input custom text content in a text field
3. WHEN selecting font style THEN I SHALL have a dropdown with font options including Arial
4. WHEN choosing text color THEN I SHALL have preset color options (black, white, red, green, blue, orange) plus custom color picker
5. WHEN adjusting font size THEN I SHALL use a slider control
6. WHEN modifying opacity THEN I SHALL use a slider with percentage display
7. WHEN changing text dimensions THEN I SHALL have separate sliders for width and height stretch
8. WHEN positioning text THEN I SHALL have sliders for horizontal, vertical, and rotation controls
9. WHEN positioning text THEN I SHALL be able to drag text elements directly on the canvas to custom positions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage text layers effectively, so that I can control text positioning relative to the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with text THEN I SHALL see text layer options for "Behind Image" and "On Top of Image"
2. WHEN selecting "Behind Image" THEN the text SHALL appear behind the main subject
3. WHEN selecting "On Top of Image" THEN the text SHALL appear as an overlay
4. WHEN switching between layers THEN the change SHALL be immediately visible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple text elements and manage them efficiently, so that I can create complex designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with text THEN I SHALL see an "Add Text" button to create new text elements
2. WHEN multiple text elements exist THEN each SHALL have a removable tag (like "Ukeme" with X button)
3. WHEN clicking the X on a text tag THEN that text element SHALL be removed
4. WHEN selecting different text tags THEN the controls SHALL update to show that text's properties

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want reset and download functionality, so that I can manage my editing workflow effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing an image THEN I SHALL see a "Reset Changes" button
2. WHEN clicking "Reset Changes" THEN all modifications SHALL be reverted to the original image
3. WHEN ready to save THEN I SHALL see a "Download" button
4. WHEN clicking "Download" THEN the final image with text overlays SHALL be downloaded

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want accurate foreground/background segmentation, so that text placed "behind" objects appears realistically integrated with the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading an image THEN the system SHALL accurately identify foreground objects using an advanced AI model
2. WHEN the AI processes the image THEN it SHALL generate precise masks for object boundaries
3. WHEN placing text "behind" objects THEN the text SHALL appear correctly behind the foreground elements
4. WHEN the image contains multiple objects THEN the system SHALL handle complex segmentation scenarios
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or error handling
6. WHEN segmentation is complete THEN the processing time SHALL be under 10 seconds for typical images
